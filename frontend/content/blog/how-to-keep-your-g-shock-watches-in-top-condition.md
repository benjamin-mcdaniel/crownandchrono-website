# How to Keep Your G Shock Watches in Top Condition

G Shock watches are renowned for their durability and ruggedness, but even these hardy timepieces need a little bit of TLC to keep them in tip-top condition. While G Shock watches are designed to withstand the elements and last for years, regular maintenance is necessary to ensure that your watch continues working like new. From cleaning your watch regularly to replacing the battery every two years, there are some easy steps you can take to keep your G shock running smoothly. Here we’ll discuss seven tips on how you can maintain your G Shock so it will continue functioning as expected.

## 1. Clean the watch regularly with a soft cloth

Your watch is an important accessory. It not only tells you the time, but it also makes a statement about your style. To ensure that your watch looks its best, you must clean it regularly with a soft cloth. Below are some tips on how to do this correctly. 

### Clean the Band Regularly 

The band of your watch comes in contact with your skin and can accumulate dirt and oils over time. To keep it looking its best, it’s important to clean the band regularly with a soft cloth. Start by wiping off any dust or dirt with a damp cloth or cotton ball. If there is any stubborn dirt or grime, use a mild soap and water solution to gently scrub the band until all debris is removed. Once you are finished cleaning, make sure to dry the band completely before putting it back on your wrist.    

### Polish the Face of Your Watch 

The face of your watch should be cleaned using a polishing cloth that is specifically designed for watches. To start, gently wipe away any dust or dirt from the surface of the face using small circular motions. Then use a polishing compound to remove any scratches or scuff marks that may have accumulated over time. Be sure to follow all directions provided by the manufacturer when applying the polishing compound and remove all residue once you are finished before putting on the watch again.   

## 2. Store your G Shock in a cool, dry place when not in use

Storing your G Shock in a cool, dry place is essential to ensuring its longevity. Excessive heat or dampness can cause components to break down, leaving you with an expensive repair bill. If your G Shock is going unused for extended periods of time, be sure to store it in the environment recommended by the manufacturer - this will keep it running smoothly for years. Properly storing such reliable and resilient tools will help you get the most out of them and make sure that you never have to worry about missing an important event or meeting due to equipment failure.

## 3. Avoid exposing it to extreme temperatures or sudden temperature changes

When caring for your watch, it is important to take extreme temperatures into account. High temperatures and sudden temperature changes can damage the built-in mechanisms of a watch, so keep it away from direct sunlight or open flames. Sudden significant temperature drops are especially damaging, as these can cause condensation to form inside the watch and corrode its components. To maintain the integrity of your mechanical timepiece, store it in an environment that has a stable and moderate temperature. With proper maintenance and care, your watch will remain in great condition for many years to come.

## 4. Change out the battery every two years for optimal performance

When you invest in a watch, it is important to remind yourself that regular maintenance and upkeep are necessary. To ensure optimal performance and accuracy, it is recommended to change the battery every two years. This will help maintain the health of your watch and extend its life. Additionally, changing the battery regularly can prevent any additional damage or malfunction that may occur if an outdated battery were used. When it's time for a battery replacement, take your watch to an experienced technician who can safely and securely remove and replace the battery as needed.

## 5. Have an authorized service center inspect and maintain your watch once a year

It's important to keep your watch maintained and running properly. An authorized service center offers a full list of services, from cleaning and lubrication to component replacements, that can help keep it in good condition for years to come. Regular maintenance also helps you avoid long-term problems that could be expensive or time consuming to fix. A certified technician will make sure everything is running smoothly and at the right speed while helping improve the accuracy and performance of your watch. For the ultimate protection and peace of mind, it's best to have your watch inspected and serviced by an authorized service center at least once a year.

## 6. Use only genuine parts and accessories when replacing any components of your G Shock watch

It's always best to use only genuine parts and accessories when replacing components of your G Shock watch. Genuine parts are designed for optimal performance and will ensure the highest quality results, since they are specifically designed for G Shock watch models. Avoid using cheap knock-off replacement parts, as these may have incompatible dimensions or reduced functionality. Using only genuine parts ensures a secure fit and trouble-free operation, so you can get the most out of your investment in a G Shock watch today and in the future.

## 7. Keep track of the warranty information so that you can take advantage of any repair services offered by Casio if necessary
