# **The History of Citizen Watch: A Look Back at the World's Favorite Timepieces**

Citizen Watch Company has been a world leader in watchmaking since 1918. From its early days as an innovative manufacturer of pocket watches, Citizen has evolved into one of the most recognised and respected names in timepieces around the globe. Over its more than 100-year history, Citizen has created iconic models that have become synonymous with quality and style, while also adapting to changing technology and fashion trends. Today, it continues to be a trendsetter with commitment to sustainability and social responsibility initiatives that shape its future outlook. This article will provide an overview of Citizen's rich history, from inception to present day.

## 1. Overview of Citizen Watch Company

Citizen's beginnings trace back to 1908 when Kamekichi Tokei established his first watch store in Tokyo's Ginza district. In 1918, he opened the "Shokosha Watch Research Institute" and began manufacturing clocks and other timepieces under his own brand name. By 1924, he had developed several successful wristwatch models that were sold throughout Japan. The same year saw the introduction of the first Japanese-made pocket watch with an alarm function. 

In 1930, the company changed its name to Citizen after receiving numerous awards both domestically and abroad for its innovative products. During World War II, Citizen focused on producing military watches for Japan’s armed forces as well as aviator chronographs for pilots in combat missions. In 1956, it released its first automatic-winding watch and two years later introduced a new series of watches featuring water resistance up to 200 meters underwater. 

In 1976, Citizen launched its Eco-Drive technology which allowed some of their watches to run on solar power. This innovation quickly became popular worldwide and is still used today in many models from the company’s lineup. In recent years, Citizen has continued to develop cutting-edge technology such as Bluetooth connectivity between devices or atomic timekeeping that allows accuracy within 1 second over 6 million years! 

From humble beginnings in 1908 to becoming one of the world's leading watch makers over a century later—the story of Citizen Watch Company is truly remarkable! Throughout its history, Citizen has stayed true to its mission of creating watches that are reliable, accurate, technologically advanced and stylish – all while keeping up with changing times and trends. With an ever increasing range of products that feature both classic designs and modern features—Citizen will undoubtedly continue to be a leader in quality timepieces into the future!

## 3. Popular models and designs throughout the years

The Citizen Watch Company has been a leading manufacturer of watches since 1918. Throughout its more than 100-year history, the company has produced many iconic designs and models. From its original pocket watch to its modern-day watches that feature solar power technology and Bluetooth connectivity, Citizen has continually pushed the envelope in terms of style and design. Let's take a look at some of the most popular models and designs from throughout the years. 

### The Early Years - 1920s to 1950s 

The first wristwatch produced by Citizen was released in 1924, which was followed by their first pocket watch in 1925. During this period, Citizen developed several classic watch styles, including the "Normal" pocket watch (1929), the "Chronomaster" (1935) and the "Citizen Captain" (1950). These designs featured sleek lines, contrasting colors, and easily-readable dials with Roman numerals or Arabic numbers. Though these watches are now considered vintage pieces, they remain highly sought after by collectors. 

### The 1960s to 1980s 

In 1964, Citizen released its first quartz timepiece—the Crystron Mega. This marked an important milestone for both Citizen and quartz watches in general; prior to this release, quartz movements had only been used rarely in high-end watches due to their relative expense. The Crystron Mega changed all that; it was affordable yet still kept accurate time thanks to its high-precision quartz movement. Over time, Citizen would release dozens of other quartz models—many of which were very popular with consumers around the world.   

### The Modern Era - 1990s to Present Day 

In 1991, Citizen introduced one of its most iconic models—the Promaster Aqualand Dive Watch—which featured a depth sensor that allowed users to track their dive depths up to 100 meters below sea level without sacrificing accuracy or reliability. Since then, Citizen has continued to innovate in terms of design and technology; over the last two decades alone, they've released several groundbreaking models featuring advanced features such as solar power technology and Bluetooth connectivity. Today’s modern citizen watches continue to combine classic elegance with cutting-edge technologies that make them stand out from other brands on the market today. 

With more than 100 years of experience under its belt, it's no wonder that Citizen is one of the foremost names when it comes to watchmaking excellence. Throughout its history, the company has consistently pushed itself forward in terms of design and technology; whether you're looking for a timeless classic or a cutting-edge modern model with all the latest features, there's sure to be something perfect for you in their extensive catalog! Whether you’re an avid collector or just looking for your next statement piece watch from an industry leader like Citizens Watches—there is something for everyone!

## 4. Impact of technology on watchmaking over time

In its early days, Citizen relied almost entirely on mechanical movement for its watches. This type of movement is powered by a series of gears and springs that drive the hands around the face of the watch. In order for it to work accurately and reliably, these parts must be carefully crafted and maintained by an expert watchmaker. Mechanical movement was state-of-the-art when Citizen began producing watches but it quickly became outdated as new technologies were developed. 

### The Quartz Revolution: Battery Powered Watches 

In 1969, a revolutionary new type of watch hit the market—the quartz watch. Quartz watches use a battery to power their movement, which makes them much more accurate than mechanical watches and requires much less maintenance. This revolutionised not only how people told time but also how they thought about watches in general; no longer were they simply tools for telling time but fashion statements as well. Because quartz watches were so much cheaper to produce than mechanical ones, many companies—including Citizen—began producing quartz watches en masse in order to meet consumer demand. 

### Entering The Digital Age: Smartwatches 

Today, we are entering a new era in watchmaking—the digital age. Smartwatches are becoming increasingly popular and they offer features that no other type of watch can match, such as built-in fitness tracking and access to phone notifications right on your wrist. Smartwatches are still relatively new but they are quickly becoming more advanced with each passing day; some even offer voice control capabilities or virtual reality experiences! As this technology continues to improve, smartwatches could eventually replace traditional analog watches altogether. 

From its humble beginnings as a mechanical timepiece maker to its current status as one of the foremost innovators in digital technology, Citizens Watches has been at the forefront of many important technological advancements in recent history. Over the years, technology has had an immense impact on both how Citizens Watches produces its products and how consumers interact with them; from quartz movements to smartwatch capabilities and beyond! As technology continues to evolve Citizen will be there every step of way providing quality products that make life easier for everyone who wears them!

## 5. How Citizen watches have evolved with fashion trends

The history of Citizen’s success begins with a dedication to quality craftsmanship and design. Every watch is constructed from scratch, using the highest-grade materials available on the market. The company also uses high-quality movements, dials, and cases that are designed to last a lifetime. This commitment to excellence ensures that each watch is built to last, even as fashion trends come and go. 

### Citizen’s Commitment to Innovation 

In addition to its dedication to high-quality materials, Citizen has distinguished itself through its commitment to innovation. Citizen is always looking for ways to make their watches more technologically advanced and aesthetically pleasing. For example, in 1976 they introduced their first solar-powered watch – a revolutionary development at the time. Since then, they have continued pushing boundaries by introducing new features such as water resistance or GPS satellite synchronisation technology into their designs.  

### Adapting with the Times 

Citizen watches have also adapted with changing fashion trends over time by introducing new styles and designs into their collections each year. From classic leather straps to modern metal bands, there is something for everyone in their collection of watches—no matter what style you prefer! And because every piece is crafted from scratch using only the highest quality materials available on the market today, you can trust that any watch you choose will be timelessly stylish and long lasting too!
