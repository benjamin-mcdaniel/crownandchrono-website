# Complete Watch Terminology Glossary for Enthusiasts

The world of watches has its own specialized language that can be intimidating to newcomers. Whether you're just starting your [watch collecting journey](/beginners-guide-to-watch-collecting-where-to-start) or looking to deepen your horological knowledge, this comprehensive glossary covers the essential terminology every watch enthusiast should know—from basic anatomy to complex movement terms and collecting jargon.

## Watch Anatomy Terms

### External Components

**Bezel**: The ring surrounding the crystal that holds it in place. May be fixed, rotating (as in dive watches like the [Rolex Submariner](/9-things-you-didnt-know-about-the-rolex-submariner-date)), or feature scales like tachymeters.

**Case**: The metal housing that contains the watch movement and dial. Cases can be made from various materials including stainless steel, gold, titanium, ceramic, or carbon fiber.

**Case Back**: The rear cover of the watch case. May be solid, display (with a transparent window), or screw-down for enhanced [water resistance](/watch-water-resistance-explained-from-splash-proof-to-deep-diving).

**Crown**: The knob on the side of the watch used to wind the movement, set the time, or adjust complications. May be screw-down on sports and dive watches for water resistance.

**Crown Guards**: Protrusions on the case that protect the crown from impacts.

**Crystal**: The transparent cover that protects the dial and hands. Common materials include:
- **Acrylic**: Plastic crystal used in vintage and budget watches
- **Mineral**: Hardened glass with decent scratch resistance
- **Sapphire**: Extremely scratch-resistant synthetic crystal used in luxury watches

**Dial**: The face of the watch, displaying the time indicators. Also called the "watch face."

**End Links**: The parts of a bracelet that connect to the watch case.

**Hands**: Pointers that indicate the time or other information:
- **Hour Hand**: The shorter hand indicating hours
- **Minute Hand**: The longer hand indicating minutes
- **Second Hand**: The thin hand that completes one rotation per minute
- **Chronograph Hands**: Additional hands for timing functions

**Helium Escape Valve**: A one-way valve found on professional dive watches that releases helium molecules during decompression after saturation diving.

**Lugs**: Protrusions from the watch case where the bracelet or strap attaches. The distance between lugs is the "lug width," a critical measurement for strap compatibility.

**Pusher**: Button(s) on the side of the case used to control complications like chronographs or calendar functions.

**Rehaut**: The inner bezel ring between the dial and crystal, often engraved with the brand name or serial numbers in modern Rolex watches.

**Strap/Bracelet**: The band that secures the watch to the wrist:
- **Bracelet**: Made of metal links
- **Strap**: Made of leather, rubber, fabric, or other non-metal materials

### Dial Elements

**Applied Markers**: Three-dimensional hour markers attached to the dial, as opposed to printed markers.

**Chapter Ring**: The perimeter of the dial where minute or second markers are printed.

**Complications**: Any function beyond simple hours and minutes. See our article on [Watch Complications](/the-art-of-watch-complications-from-chronographs-to-tourbillons) for more detail.

**Date Window**: Aperture showing the current date.

**Indices**: Hour markers on the dial, which may be applied, painted, or represented by numerals.

**Lume**: Luminous material applied to hands and markers for visibility in darkness.

**Sub-dial**: Smaller dial within the main dial, typically used for complications like chronograph minutes/hours or small seconds.

## Movement Terminology

### Types of Movements

**Automatic Movement**: Self-winding mechanical movement powered by the motion of the wearer's wrist. See our [Watch Movements Guide](/understanding-watch-movements-automatic-vs-quartz-vs-manual) for details.

**Manual Movement**: Hand-wound mechanical movement requiring daily winding via the crown.

**Quartz Movement**: Battery-powered electronic movement using a quartz crystal oscillator for timekeeping.

**Solar Movement**: Quartz movement powered by light energy, like [Citizen's Eco-Drive](/a-timeless-classic-reimagined-the-mens-citizen-eco-drive).

**Spring Drive**: Seiko's hybrid technology using a spring-driven gear train regulated by an electronic brake.

**Kinetic/Automatic Quartz**: Movements that generate electricity through wrist motion to power a quartz movement.

### Movement Components and Terms

**Balance Spring/Hairspring**: Spiral spring that works with the balance wheel to regulate timekeeping.

**Balance Wheel**: The oscillating wheel that serves as the regulating organ of a mechanical watch.

**Barrel**: Container housing the mainspring.

**Beat Rate**: Frequency of balance wheel oscillations, typically expressed in vibrations per hour (vph) or Hertz (Hz).
- Common rates: 18,000 vph (2.5 Hz), 21,600 vph (3 Hz), 28,800 vph (4 Hz), 36,000 vph (5 Hz)

**Bridges**: Metal plates that support various movement components.

**Caliber**: Specific model/type of watch movement.

**Côtes de Genève**: Decorative striped finishing often applied to movement surfaces.

**Escapement**: Mechanism that transfers energy from the mainspring to the balance wheel in controlled amounts.

**Incabloc**: Brand name for a common shock protection system.

**Jewels**: Synthetic rubies or sapphires used as bearings to reduce friction at pivot points.

**Mainspring**: Coiled spring that stores energy to power a mechanical watch.

**Perlage**: Circular graining decoration on movement parts.

**Power Reserve**: Amount of time a mechanical watch will run after being fully wound.

**Regulation**: Process of adjusting a watch's rate for accuracy.

**Rotor**: Semicircular weight in an automatic watch that winds the mainspring through wrist motion.

**COSC**: Contrôle Officiel Suisse des Chronomètres, the official Swiss chronometer testing agency. COSC-certified watches meet specific accuracy standards.

## Watch Complications
