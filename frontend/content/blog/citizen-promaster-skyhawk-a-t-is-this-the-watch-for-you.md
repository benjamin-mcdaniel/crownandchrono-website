## 5. How to maintain a Citizen Promaster Skyhawk A-T

The Citizen Promaster Skyhawk A-T watch is a stylish, sophisticated timepiece that helps you stand out from the crowd. But in order to maintain its good looks and performance, regular maintenance is key. In this blog post, we'll go over some of the main things you should do to maintain your watch and keep it looking great for years to come. 

### Proper Care and Cleaning 

Your watch needs to be cleaned regularly in order to keep it looking good and functioning properly. To start, wipe off any dirt or dust with a soft cloth. Use only mild soap (no detergents!) when cleaning your watch, as harsh chemicals can damage the casing or straps. If necessary, you can use a soft brush such as an old toothbrush to gently remove dirt from crevices or straps. Make sure the crown (the small knob at the top of the watch) is securely closed before cleaning; if water gets inside the watch, it may cause serious damage. 

### Water Resistance 

The Citizen Promaster Skyhawk A-T has been designed with water resistance up to 200m (660ft); however, this doesn't mean you should wear it while swimming or showering! The seals around the buttons and crown should be checked regularly—once every six months—to make sure they are still firmly in place and not damaged by wear and tear over time. If there is any visible damage or signs of wear, take your watch into an authorized service center for repair or replacement immediately.
