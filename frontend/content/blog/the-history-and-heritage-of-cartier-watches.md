## 1. The History of Cartier watches

Cartier watches have a long and fascinating history. Founded in Paris, France in 1847, Cartier has been one of the premier watchmakers in the world for almost two centuries. From its humble beginnings as a small jewelry shop to its current status as an iconic luxury brand, Cartier has always strived for excellence in design, craftsmanship, and innovation. Let's take a look at the [evolution of this legendary watchmaker](/evolution-of-major-watch-brands-through-history). 

### The Early Years (1847-1907) 

Cartier was founded by Louis-Francois Cartier in 1847. He opened his first store in Paris on Rue Montorgueil and quickly became known for his exquisite jewelry designs. In 1899, he passed the company down to his three sons—Louis, Pierre, and Jacques—who continued their father’s work and expanded the business even further. During this period, they also began producing high-quality timepieces that were inspired by their jewelry creations.            

### The Golden Age (1907-1945) 

In 1907, Louis Cartier commissioned Edmond Jaeger to create a wristwatch for one of his friends who was an aviator—the Santos de Cartier watch was born. The success of this watch propelled Cartier into the golden age of watchmaking which lasted until 1945. During this period, they released some of their most iconic models such as the Tank (1917), Crash (1967), Pasha de Cartier (1985), and more. They also developed many new movements and technological innovations during this time. These classic models are highly sought after by [watch collectors](/beginners-guide-to-watch-collecting-where-to-start) and often [hold their value well](/investing-in-luxury-watches-brands-that-hold-their-value).

## How Cartier has evolved over time

Cartier watches have been around since the late 19th century and have evolved over time to become a timeless classic. Since 1847, Cartier has been producing high-quality watches that are stylish and practical. Let’s take a look at how Cartier watches have changed over the years. 

### The Early Days of Cartier Watches (1847–1920) 

In 1847, Louis-Francois Cartier founded his namesake company in Paris, France. From the very beginning, Louis-Francois was committed to providing luxurious and dependable timepieces. He quickly earned a reputation for producing high-end pocket watches and clocks with unique designs that were both functional and fashionable. By 1900, the company had opened its first store outside of France in London and was becoming increasingly popular among royalty and celebrities around the world. 

### The Rise of the Wristwatch (1920–1980) 

In 1904, Louis-Francois’ son Alfred designed one of the earliest known wristwatches for Brazilian aviator Alberto Santos-Dumont. This watch, which featured a gold case with an intricately engraved back, set off a trend among pilots and other adventurers who wanted a more convenient way to tell time while on the go. In 1917, Cartier began producing its own line of wristwatches under the brand name “Cartier Tank” — one of many iconic designs that would be released in subsequent decades. 

### Cartier Today (1980–Present) 

In recent decades, Cartier has continued to innovate with its line of watches by introducing new materials and features such as sapphire crystals for scratch resistance and shock protection systems to protect delicate movements from damage due to impacts or extreme temperatures. Today, Cartier is widely considered one of the most luxurious watch brands in existence — with some models selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars — making them highly sought after by collectors all over the world.  

## The different types of materials used to create these watches

Since its founding in 1847, Cartier has become one of the world’s most renowned luxury watchmakers—and for good reason. Their watches feature exquisite designs and premium materials that make them stand out from other watchmakers. Below, we take a look at some of the materials used to create Cartier watches. 

### Gold 

Gold is one of the most commonly used materials when creating Cartier watches. This precious metal is associated with luxury and quality and is an essential component in many of the brand’s iconic models. Gold can be found in a variety of shades ranging from yellow gold to rose gold to white gold, giving customers plenty of options to choose from. The use of gold also makes each watch model more durable and resistant to scratches and wear-and-tear over time. 

### Platinum 

Another popular material used to create Cartier watches is platinum. This luxurious metal gives each watch a unique shine and offers superior durability compared to other metals like silver or gold. Platinum also adds a touch of sophistication and elegance that makes it perfect for formal occasions or special events. It is also highly resistant to tarnishing, making it ideal for long-term use. 

### Steel 

Finally, steel is another common material used by Cartier when crafting their watches. Steel offers superior strength and durability compared to other metals, making it perfect for active lifestyles or outdoor activities like hiking or camping. Steel also has a sleek finish that makes it great for everyday wear, as well as special occasions like weddings or parties. Plus, because steel is less expensive than other metals like platinum or gold, it makes Cartier watches more accessible for many individuals who may not otherwise be able to afford them. 

## Conclusion

Cartier creates some of the finest watches in the world thanks to their attention to detail and commitment to using only the best materials available on the market today. From classic looks like gold and platinum all the way up to modern materials such as steel, Cartier ensures that every watch they produce meets their high standards for quality craftsmanship and elegance—ensuring that those who wear them remain stylish [no matter the occasion](/choosing-the-right-watch-for-every-occasion).
