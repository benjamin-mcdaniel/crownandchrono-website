## 2. Water-resistant up to 200 meters – Perfect for scuba diving, swimming, or any other water activities

You’ve probably heard people talking about how their watches are water resistant, but what does that actually mean? Being water resistant means that your watch is protected from water damage up to a certain level. If you want a watch that can withstand more than just a few splashes, you should look for one with 200m (or 20ATM) water resistance. Here's why it's so important to have a watch with this level of waterproofing. 

### What Does 200m Water Resistance Mean? 

200m water resistance is the highest rating you will find on many watches (though some professional dive watches offer even greater depths). This means that your watch will be able to withstand being submerged in depths of up to 200 meters without any damage. That's deeper than most swimming pools and more than enough protection for any diving adventures you may take. It also means that your watch can withstand any amount of splashing or accidental submersion without sustaining any kind of damage. For a complete understanding of water resistance ratings, check out our guide on [Watch Water Resistance Explained](/watch-water-resistance-explained-from-splash-proof-to-deep-diving). 

### Why Is It Important? 

Having a watch with 200m water resistance is important not only because it ensures your safety when swimming or diving, but also because it means your watch will last much longer than one with less protection against the elements. A watch with less water resistance may be able to withstand some splashes, but as soon as it gets wet its lifespan starts to decrease significantly. With a 200m-rated water-resistant watch, you don’t have to worry about replacing it anytime soon—you can simply enjoy wearing an elegant timepiece without fear of damaging it! 

### The Other Benefits 

In addition to providing superior protection against moisture and other liquids, watches with 200m water resistance offer additional benefits such as improved legibility and better shock absorption. Watches with this level of protection are designed with thicker cases and stronger seals which make them less likely to be damaged by shocks or vibrations—perfect for active lifestyles! Furthermore, these watches feature extra-large hands and markers which makes them easier to read even in low light conditions—a great feature if you are often out at night or underwater! 

Having a 200m water resistant watch is essential if you plan on going swimming or diving regularly—or even if you just want peace of mind knowing that your expensive timepiece won't get ruined by accident. Not only does this type of rating provide superior protection from liquid damage, but it also offers improved legibility and better shock absorption for those who lead active lifestyles. So if you're looking for a quality timepiece that can handle anything life throws at it, make sure yours has at least 200M (20ATM) water resistance!

## 3. Eco-Drive Technology – No need to worry about changing batteries as this watch is powered by light

Citizen's Eco-Drive Technology represents one of the most innovative [watch movements](/understanding-watch-movements-automatic-vs-quartz-vs-manual) on the market, offering a perfect blend of traditional quartz accuracy with renewable energy sustainability.

Citizen's innovative Eco-Drive technology is one of several [watch movement types](/understanding-watch-movements-automatic-vs-quartz-vs-manual) that make modern timepieces more convenient and reliable. 

Eco-Drive technology is a revolutionary way to power watches and other devices. This technology utilizes natural and artificial light sources to provide the energy needed to keep your device running optimally. In this blog post, we’ll discuss why Eco-Drive technology is the future of powering devices. 

### How does it work? 

Eco-Drive technology utilizes a solar panel that captures natural and artificial light from the environment. This captured light is then converted into electrical energy which powers the device's timekeeping functions as well as any other features. By harnessing energy from our surroundings, we can reduce our reliance on batteries and create more sustainable products. 

### The Benefits of Eco-Drive Technology 

The most obvious benefit of Eco-Drive technology is that you never have to worry about changing your battery ever again! Not only does this save you money in battery costs, but it also reduces the environmental impact of these products since they no longer require disposable batteries that end up in landfills. Furthermore, Eco-Drive powered devices are typically more accurate than those powered by traditional batteries since they don't suffer from inconsistent performance due to low levels of charge.  Eco-Drive technology has been around for a while now and has been used in watches, calculators, cameras, flashlights and more. It's quickly becoming the preferred choice for powering small devices due to its convenience and environmental benefits. 

In conclusion, Eco-Drive technology is an innovative way to power watches and other small devices without having to worry about replacing batteries every few months. Not only does this save you money in battery costs, but it also reduces our collective environmental impact since these products no longer require disposable batteries that end up in landfills. If you're looking for a convenient and eco-friendly way to power your device or watch, consider investing in an item that uses Eco-Drive technology today! You won't regret it!

## 4. Rotating Bezel – Helps you keep track of elapsed time when diving or swimming

When spending time in the water, it's important to have some sort of understanding of how long you've been submerged or how much longer until your next dive or session. You don't want to risk going too deep or staying underwater for too long without taking regular breaks for safety reasons. The rotating bezel is one of the most practical [watch complications](/the-art-of-watch-complications-from-chronographs-to-tourbillons) for divers and swimmers. With a rotating bezel, keeping track of this information becomes incredibly simple – all you need to do is rotate the outer ring until it lines up with the current position on the watch face! This means that no matter how deep you go, what kind of currents are present, or how strong the waves become – you'll always know exactly how much longer until your next break from the water!  

## 5. Luminous Hands &amp; Markers– Make it easy to read your watch in low light conditions

Luminous hands and markers are features available on many watches today that make it easier to read the time in low light conditions. By absorbing sunlight or artificial light, the hands and markers glow in the dark for hours after dark, allowing you to easily tell the time without having to strain your eyes. Different watches use different materials for their luminous elements– some use tritium-based illumination, others phosphorus compounds, and newer technology utilizes electroluminescent properties that shine brightly for long periods of time. Whether you're spending a night out or camping under the stars, Luminous hands and markers add an extra level of convenience so you never have to guess what time it is.

## 6. Date Window– Keep track of important dates without having to look at your phone or calendar

Staying on top of all your important dates and events has never been easier with the Date Window. Every day, this intuitive piece of technology can quickly remind you of upcoming birthdays, anniversaries, project due dates, and other occasions. So whether you're prone to misplacing your phone or are frequently forgetting what day or even month it is, the Date Window is here to save the day by keeping an accurate log and alerting you ahead of time! No more worrying about what event might be coming up next; now all you have to do is check the Date Window and have a clear view of what's ahead.

## 7. Anti-reflective Coating– Reduce glare from bright lights and make it easier on the eyes when looking at the dial

Anti-reflective coating is an incredible technology designed to reduce the amount of glare produced when looking at the face of your watch. Its applications are two-fold: not only does it help to protect eyes from scanning and glare from bright lights, but also makes viewing watch faces much easier on the eyes -- resulting in a more comfortable experience. This is especially useful when trying to read text or view intricate details on a watch. Anti-reflective coating enhances visibility and also has less of a tendency to smudge or become smeared as opposed to standard reflections -- making your watch appear cleaner and crisper. For these reasons, anti-reflective coating is an important feature to consider when purchasing a new watch.

## 8. 24 Hour Subdial– Quickly tell what time it is no matter where you are in the world

Knowing the current time can be a challenge when you're traveling or dealing with multiple time zones. That's why having a watch with a 24 Hour Subdial is so handy! This sophisticated feature tells the time no matter where you are in the world, using two hands that rotate once around the dial every 24 hours. The hour hand changes at half-hour intervals to indicate morning and afternoon, and advances forward or back to correspond with the current time zone. With this clever design, it's always now and it only takes a glance! Wear a watch with 24 Hour Subdial and never worry about telling time again.

## 9. Multiple Band Options– Choose from different bands such as leather, metal link, or rubber strap for a customized look

Are you looking for a way to customize your watch? With different band options, you can create a look that is uniquely yours. From leather and metal link bands to rubber straps, there are loads of possibilities when it comes to creating your own style. Keep reading to learn more about the various band options available so you can find the perfect choice for your watch. 

### Leather Bands 

Leather bands offer a classic look that never goes out of style. Whether you're looking for something dressy or casual, leather is always an excellent option. Plus, it's comfortable—just make sure to get one with enough holes so you can adjust it perfectly to your wrist size. If you're looking for something dressy but don't want a metal link band, then a black leather band is the perfect compromise. They come in a variety of colors and textures, from plain black to embossed croc-skin - so take some time to explore all the different options before settling on one! The versatility of band options makes this watch perfect for [choosing the right watch for every occasion](/choosing-the-right-watch-for-every-occasion). 

### Metal Link Bands 

For those who prefer something more formal and classic, metal link bands are an ideal choice. These bands come in gold, silver, and other metals and feature polished links that give them an elegant look and feel. The great thing about these bands is that they are adjustable; most have removable links that allow you to customize the fit so it looks just right on your wrist. However, they can be expensive - so if you want something more affordable yet still stylish and classic, go with a leather band instead!        
### Rubber Straps 

If you’re going for a sportier look or just want something comfortable and durable while exercising or doing outdoor activities like mountain biking or running marathons, then rubber straps are exactly what you need! Rubber straps are made from flexible materials like silicone or rubber which make them lightweight yet strong enough to handle any activity without slipping off your wrist. They also come in many different colors and patterns - so if you’re feeling adventurous then go ahead and try out some fun designs!
